# discord-bot
Discord bot in Java that I have been working on

You can create your own bot by going to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me and creating a new bot.

Create a bot user for it, and then go the this link to add your bot to your server:

`https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=<CLIENT-ID>&scope=bot&permissions=0`  
(Replace the `<CLIENT-ID>` with your bot's client ID)

To use this bot, you need a text file named "bot.key" which contains your Bot User Token, and a text file named "youtube.key" which contains your Google API key (Note that these files should not have an extra .txt at the end)
