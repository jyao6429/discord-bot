# discord-bot
Hi, I have just started to learn how to program, and this is a little project I have been working on to test out my skills. Any suggestions are appreciated!

You can create your own bot by going to [My Apps](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) in Discord and creating a new bot.

Create a bot user for it, and then go the this link to add your bot to your server:

`https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=<CLIENT-ID>&scope=bot&permissions=0`  
(Replace the `<CLIENT-ID>` with your bot's client ID)

To use this bot, you need a text file named `bot.key` which contains your Bot User Token, and a text file named `youtube.key` which contains your Google API key (Note that these files should not have an extra `.txt` at the end)
